            <p>My name is Edaad Azman, and I am a junior studying Computer Science at Boston University. I have a strong
                expertise in Python and Javascript, particularly working with the React.js framework. I have a passion
                for
                building websites, apps, and games. Outside of my academics, I play a lot of sports including football,
                basketball, tennis, and golf. I also have a passion for music as a guitar player for most of my life,
                and I
                am trying to learn piano too.</p>
            <p>Feel free to explore the different sections to learn more about my professional background.</p>
