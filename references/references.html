                <p><strong>Reference: </strong>Mostafizur Rahman</p>
                <p><strong>Position:</strong> Former Head of Product Engineering at Intelligent Machines</p>
                <p><strong>Relationship: </strong> Mostafizur managed Edaad directly at Intelligent Machines</p>
                <p>Working with Edaad at Intelligent Machines was an excellent experience. He joined our team as a
                    summer intern and adapted to our engineering culture remarkably fast. His perseverance and
                    dedication made it possible to successfully participate in the production release within the small
                    period of his internship. I found him truly focused, hard working and self motivated throughout the
                    period he worked with me.

                    I heartily recommend working with Edaad if you're looking for someone who gets the work done while
                    open for feedback and always striving to be a great engineer and a fantastic team member.</p>

                <p><strong>Relationship: </strong> Shakil managed Edaad directly at Intelligent Machines</p>
                <p>I had the pleasure of having Edaad Azman as an intern in our Product Engineering team at Intelligent
                    Machines. He consistently impressed us with his keen interest in technology and programming. Edaad
                    quickly grasped new concepts and demonstrated the ability to apply them effectively. He is a fast
                    learner, dedicated to his work, and has a bright future ahead in the tech industry. I highly
                    recommend him for any role that demands strong technical skills and a passion for learning.</p>
